### removes all occurrences of a substring part from a given string s
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to remove all occurrences of the substring `part` from the string `s`
    string removeOccurrences(string s, string part) {
        
        // Keep running the loop as long as `s` is not empty and `part` is found within `s`
        while (s.length() != 0 && s.find(part) < s.length()) {
            
            // Find the starting index of `part` in `s` and erase it
            // s.find(part) returns the first occurrence of `part` in `s`
            // s.erase(index, length) removes the substring starting from `index` with the length of `part`
            s.erase(s.find(part), part.length());
        }
        
        // Return the final modified string after removing all occurrences of `part`
        return s;
    }
};
```

#### Example:
```c++
s = "daabcbaabcbc";
part = "abc";
```
Execution:
    - Initial String: `"daabcbaabcbc"`
    - The substring `"abc"` is found at index 2:
        - Erase `"abc"` from the string, which changes `s` to `"dabbaabcbc"`.
    - Updated String: `"dabbaabcbc"`
    - The substring `"abc"` is found again, this time at index 6:
        - Erase `"abc"` from the string, which changes s to `"dabbbc"`.
    - Updated String:` "dabbbc"`
    - Now, the substring `"abc"` is no longer found in s.

###### Output:
`"dabbbc"`

###### Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Example:
1. First loop iteration:
    - `s = "daabcbaabcbc"`, `s.find(part) = 2`.
    - Remove `"abc"` from index 2.
    - Updated `s = "dabbaabcbc"`.
2. Second loop iteration:
    - `s = "dabbaabcbc`", `s.find(part) = 6`.
    - Remove `"abc"` from index 6.
    - Updated `s = "dabbbc"`.
3. Third loop iteration:
    - `s = "dabbbc"`, `s.find(part)` does not find `"abc"`, so the loop ends.
4. Final result:` "dabbbc"`

### What is a 2D Array?
    - A 2D array is an array of arrays, where data is stored in a grid-like structure.
    - It's like a table with rows and columns. Each element is accessed using two indices: one for the row and one for the column.

### Declaration and Initialization:
- Static Declaration
```c++
int arr[rows][cols];
```

- Initialization during Declaration
```c++
int arr[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};
```

### Accessing Elements:
- Elements in a 2D array are accessed using arr[row][column].
- Example: arr[1][2] refers to the element in the second row and third column.
- Rows and columns are zero-indexed, meaning the first row is at index 0 and the first column is at index 0.

### Input/Output for 2D Arrays:
- Input: Values can be assigned using nested loops
```c++
for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        cin >> arr[i][j];
    }
}
```

- Output: Printing a 2D array is done similarly
```c++
for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        cout << arr[i][j] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl; // Newline after each row
}
```

### Memory Representation:
- Row-Major Order: The array is stored in memory row by row. All elements of the first row are stored first, followed by the elements of the second row, and so on.
- Example: In a 2D array `arr[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}`, the memory layout is: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

### Dynamic 2D Array:
- You can dynamically allocate a 2D array using pointers and `new`
```c++
int** arr = new int*[rows]; // Create row pointers
for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    arr[i] = new int[cols]; // Create each row
}
```
- To free this memory, use
```c++
for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    delete[] arr[i]; // Delete each row
}
delete[] arr; // Delete the row pointers
```

### Common Operations:
- Matrix Addition:
    - Add corresponding elements from two matrices.
    ```c++
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        result[i][j] = matrix1[i][j] + matrix2[i][j];
    }
    }
    ```

- Matrix Multiplication:
    - Multiply two matrices using the formula:
    ```c++
    result[i][j] = sum(matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j]); // Across rows and columns

    ```

### Applications of 2D Arrays:
- Matrices: Mathematical operations (e.g., addition, multiplication, transposition).
- Grids: Games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Sudoku, Minesweeper.
- Image Processing: Representing pixels of an image.
- Graph Representation: Adjacency matrix for representing graphs.

### Limitations:
- Static Size: If a 2D array is statically declared, the size must be known at compile-time. Use dynamic memory for flexibility.
- Memory Usage: 2D arrays can consume a lot of memory for large matrices.
